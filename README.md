Hi, my name is @Zekumoru and I am currently learning C#, Unity, JavaScript, and Pre-Calculus.

I have learnt Java, C, and C++. Learned the fundamentals on computer architecture through the 
book The Elements of Computing System, which, I made a working Assembler and VM Compiler
for the Jack language.

I have also worked with Android development and made simple applications to suit my needs, and 
helped other people on their Android projects through StackOverflow. You can find my profile here:

Other skills I have experienced working with is RPG Maker (VX Ace, MV, and MZ) and Qt GUI Programming.

Currently, I am focusing on my math knowledge, specially Calculus.
Also, on OOP concepts specially the design patterns to write code efficiently.

I plan on making a pretty big game project in the near future with Unity and another major application
on Android which I hope could impact people's lives in order to facilate a certain area on learning
new things. I am always interested on finding new ways to better myself on programming.

I play the piano and made quite few arrangements myself which you can find on this YouTube playlist:

I like RPG, Rhythm games, anime, and drawing.

At the moment, I have not yet announced any means to contact me.
